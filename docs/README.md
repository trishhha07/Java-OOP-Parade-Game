# CS102 Programming Fundamentals II: Parade Game

## Overview
Parade Game is a strategic card game for 2â€“6 players where the goal is to minimize your score. The game features turn-based mechanics, card removal rules, and a scoring system that determines the winner. This project demonstrates core Java OOP concepts, team collaboration, and console-based game design.

## My Contributions
- Implemented **core game logic** and rules for the Parade.  
- Designed **GUI interactions and user input handling**.  
- Managed **player scoring, deck management, and turn sequence**.  
- Added **custom exceptions** for input validation and game rules enforcement.  

## Technologies & Skills
- Java (OOP, classes, inheritance, interfaces)  
- Exception handling & input validation  
- Team project collaboration  
- Console-based game interface  

## Setup & Installation
1. Ensure **JDK 15+** is installed.  
2. Compile:
```bash
javac -d tempclasses -cp src src/app/Main.java
