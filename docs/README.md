 Playing a Card
 [] When a face value of 0 is played, all cards enter removal mode (take all same color cards and face value of 0 card)
 [] If the played card has a value v, then the first v cards in the Parade (from the right) are safe and cannot be removed
    --> The removal check starts from the (v+1)th card onward
 [] Then, remove cards if the colour matches and value comparison
    --> Has the same colour as the played card
    --> Has a value equal to or lower than the played card
 
 End Game Condition
 [] Game proceed to final round when one of the following happens:
     --> No more cards can be drawn from the deck
     --> A player collects all 6 colours
 [] Player discard 2 cards from their hand and add to their collection
 [] Player with the lowest score wins
 [] If players have the same score, winner will be determined based on sequence, and if winner is still unable to be determined, move to next condition until winner is announced 
    (1) Number of cards: player with lesser card collected wins
    (2) Number of collected colors: player with lesser color variety wins
    (3) Dice of Destiny: player with bigger dice value wins
